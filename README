---------
Lets the user verify the correct functionality of the Turing Machine.
Usage:	Provide the name of a Turing Machine in .xml-format (including the ".xml") STORED IN THE /DATA/ DIRECTORY OF THE PROJECT as the executable as a command line argument.
		Follow the on-screen instructions.
		See /data/ for examples of Turing Machine .xml-files.
			TM1.xml: 0^n1^n for n>=1
			TM2.xml: 01* + 10*   (uses storage in states)
			TM3.xml: wcw with w being a string of 0s and 1s    (uses storage in states AND multitrack)
		Copy one of these files to the /build/ directory and edit it as an easy way to create your own TuringMachine.
