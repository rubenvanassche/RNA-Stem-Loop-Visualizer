./RunTuring will print "String accepted" if the provided string belongs to the language described by the Turing Machine,and "String NOT accepted" if not.

Note that TuringMachineInputExample.xml has to be copied to the /data/ directory in order to work!
The TuringMachine in the example xml file is pretty pointless (it accepts all strings consisting of 0s and 1s) and is mainly meant to show the structure of a TM .xml file.
You're supposed to edit it (or use TM1, TM2 or TM3 in /data/, see README for explanations) to properly test the Turing Machine.
